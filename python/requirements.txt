# SAP MCP Server - Python Requirements
# No external dependencies - uses only Python standard library

# Python version requirement: >= 3.7
# The direct_sap_server.py is designed to work with minimal dependencies
# for maximum compatibility and easy deployment

# Optional development tools (uncomment if needed):
# pytest>=7.0.0           # For advanced testing
# black>=22.0.0           # For code formatting  
# mypy>=0.991             # For type checking
# flake8>=5.0.0           # For linting

# Note: The server uses only these standard library modules:
# - json (JSON processing)
# - sys (system interface)
# - asyncio (async I/O, Python 3.7+)
# - logging (logging support)
# - datetime (date/time handling)
# - os (operating system interface)
